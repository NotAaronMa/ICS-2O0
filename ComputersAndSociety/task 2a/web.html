			With the prevelance of the internet, more and more importatant events such as finance 
			are being done on computers, network security has becoming a far more relevant concern.
			Nowadays, a skilled hacker can bring down an entire town's social services or leak the 
			private data of millions of people. Therefore, being knowledgable of possible attacks and how 
			to avoid them is an important skill in the 21st century.
		</p>

			The first attack that we will be covering is a denial of service attack.This is done by getting many computers
			to sent a large amout of ping or POST requests to a server. The server will have to handle all these requests 
			and will most likely go down. One way to get around these attacks are to use a firewall to limit acess to your 
			server. A firewall uses techniques such as a packet filter, a proxy server or blocking certain protocals in order
			to keep a network secure. A ddos Attack does not require much skill to pull off and can be done by almost anyone who
			has the required software.

			Another common attack is the SQL injection. an SQL injection is a technique used to get a server to execute an SQL query. This 
			vunrability is caused when input to a database isn't sanitized allowing a hacker to inject code into the query making the server
			excecute unintended commands. For instance, typing in  <b> " DROP TABLE a; "</b> will cause a server to delete the table named "a" 
			someone who knows SQL can use this to wreak havoc on a server making it delete all tables or read all the data stored in the database.
			The way to avoid this is to sanatize inputs. By checking the input for SQL commands and string breaks, this vunrability can be easily
			nullified.

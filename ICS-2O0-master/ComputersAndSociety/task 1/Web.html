				an application which you can use to emulate keyboard input. This feature is ment for the two-in-one laptop form factor to add typing 
				fuctionality to the tablet mode. In order to enable the virtual keyboard, you need to get to the ease of acess menu. You can either press
				the Windows button + U or you can click on the windows icon in the bottom left of your screen, click on the settings icon to open the windows 
				settings, then click on the ease of acess menu icon.

			    The on screen keyboard should then open centred on the bottem of the screen. In order to type on this virtual keyboard, just click on the key you want to type
				or tap if you are using a touch screen. Though it is ment to be used for touch screens. This virtual keyboard can be used for other things. For instance, you can 
				interact with the keyboard with an xbox controller, allowing you to play games and type from the comfort of a couch, or, if your hands are dirty and you don't want to have to 
				clean your keyboard, you can use your mouse to type on the on screen keyboard.

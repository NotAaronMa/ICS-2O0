A data scientist uses a combination of techniques from both Statistics and Computer science to get useful information out of a large data set.
For instance, data scientists could use a neural network in order to recognize patterns in search queries to develop an algorithm that matches
advertisements to consumers.

Essential skills 
Problem solving: Required to create algorithms
Finding information: A data scientest needs to gather data to anylyse.
Data Analysis: A data Scientist has to develop algorithms to analyse data. 
Thus one must know the techniques well.

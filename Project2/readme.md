Base Pattern:
  Renders a fractal where a square is divided into 9smaller squares with the exception of the middle square.
Pattern 2
  Same code except added a col class which stores the rgb values at a certian point. Used this class to add a smooth linear gradient.
Pattern 3
  Same code as pattern 1 but removed all squares except for the corners.The middle square was replaced with a circle with a side length of 
  root 2 * side length of square so that it touches the corner of the squares

Base Pattern: 
 
	Renders a fractal where a square is divided into 9 smaller squares with the exception of the middle square. when the spacebar is clicked the
	next level of the fractal is rendered up till 6 levels where the level is reset.
Pattern 2
: 
	Same code except added a col class which stores the rgb values at a certian point. Used this class to add a smooth linear gradient 
	from the top left corner to the bottom right corner
. Added phases that change every time the level of the fractals reset
Pattern 3
: 
	Same code as pattern 1 but removed all squares except for the corners. The middle square was replaced with a circle with a side length of root 2 *
	side length of square so that it touches the corner of the squares
Pattern 4
  Used the color code from pattern 2 and applied it to pattern 3
Pattern 4:
	Took code from pattern 3 and 4 to render patern 3 but with a linear gradient
Pattern 5
  
	Pattern 2 but used a sine function to smoothly change the gradient
